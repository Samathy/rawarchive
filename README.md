#rawarchive
A small application for archiving 'rejected' RAW image files.

Images marked as 'rejected' using a RAW image processing/management tool
such as Darktable can be archived using the XMP data to save space.

Currently this tool is in development.
It will archive all rejected images in the directory you run it in.

Compile with
    $ dub build
